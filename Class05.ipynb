For historical reasons, that set of characters is the same that the 28 letters of English, plus some other single symbols such as dollar, point, slash, asterisk, etc. up to 128 single characters. That set is called the [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). But now think about other weird characters like the Spanish *\u00f1*, the French circunflect accent *r\u00f4le*, or even the whole Greek alphabet, *\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c0\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7*.

That huge set of characters is known as [Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).\n",

      "The last version of Python, which is 3, now uses Unicode as default, encoded using UTF8 (it was ASCII in Python 2, HELP!). You don't need anymore to tell it that the characters are in UTF8, but it's always better to do so by adding the comment `# coding: utf-8` at the beginning of the source file. Furthermore, in previous versions, you needed to put a prefix, `u\"\"`, to define a string as Unicode. Now the `u\"\"` is optional, but if you want to write code that works for current and older versions of Python, it's a good idea to always define strings by using the prefix.\n",
